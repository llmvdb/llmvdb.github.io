description: A venue for self-reflection in machine learning research
---

The NeurIPS Retrospectives Workshop is about reflecting on machine learning research. In addition to publishing meta-analysis papers on the state of the field, this workshop will kick-start the exploration of a new kind of scientific publication, called *retrospectives*. 

The workshop will be held **Friday, December 13th**, at the Vancouver Convention Centre (**West building, rooms 114-115**). 

### What is a retrospective?

A retrospective is written about a single paper, by that paper's author, and takes the form of an informal blog post. The purpose of a retrospective is to answer the question: 

#### *“What should readers of this paper know now, that is not in the original publication?”* 

The overarching goal of retrospectives is to do better science, increase the openness and accessibility of the machine learning field, and to show that **it’s okay to make mistakes**.
We are accompanying the workshop with the open-source release of a retrospectives platform on GitHub called [ML Retrospectives](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/), which will host retrospective submissions going forward after NeurIPS 2019.
