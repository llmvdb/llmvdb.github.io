**Title:**
<br/> Bridging Humans and Databases: Democratizing Database Interfaces with Reasoning Agents


**Abstract:**
<br/>Natural language interfaces are revolutionizing how users interact with databases, making it possible for non-experts to query and manipulate complex data systems with ease. Text-to-SQL is a key example of this transformation, enabling users to generate SQL queries from natural language. 
In this talk, we explore how reasoning agents can enhance Text-to-SQL solutions by bridging the gap between human queries and the complex logic required to generate precise SQL queries. A reasoning agent is an intelligent system capable of reasoning through a problem, selecting appropriate actions, and interacting with external tools or data sources to ensure the correctness and relevance of generated responses. Reasoning agents enhance Text-to-SQL by integrating dynamic reasoning processes and tool calls (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation). These agents interpret the intent behind a user's natural language request, adjust the query-building process in real-time, and refine queries by calling upon external knowledge sources, querying data documents, or interacting with users. We will introduce our recent efforts in this area and discuss future directions for improving the effectiveness of Text-to-SQL solutions, making database interactions more intuitive and effective.
